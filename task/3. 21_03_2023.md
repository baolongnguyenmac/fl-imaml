# Mar 20

- Task:
    - Run FedAvg, MAML, iMAML on MNIST -> write log (hyper param of iMAML: https://github.com/sshkhr/imaml)
    - Prepare data for Cifar
    - Implement Cifar model
    - Implement metrics: CPU (sec/it), GPU (%), mean accuracy

- Expected output:
    - Run FedAvg --> FedAvg performs extremely bad on non-iid data
    - Run MAML & iMAML:
        --> Better on non-iid data (mean acc + std)
        --> acc(iMAML) approx acc(MAML) but iMAML's needed computational requires less than one's MAML
    - Same thing happens to Cifar

- Deadline: At the end of 23/03/2023
